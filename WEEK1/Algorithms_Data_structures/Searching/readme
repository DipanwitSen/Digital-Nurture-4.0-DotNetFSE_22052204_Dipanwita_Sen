Exercise: E-commerce Product Search Optimization
Create a Java program for an e-commerce platform that allows searching for products using both linear search and binary search. The program should:
Define a Product class with fields: productId, productName, and category.
Take user input to enter a list of products.
Search for a product by its productId using:
Linear search on the original array.
Binary search on a sorted array.
Compare both methods based on efficiency and output the result.
Algorithm	      Best Case	  Average Case	  Worst Case
Linear Search	   O(1)	        O(n)	        O(n)
Binary Search	   O(1)	        O(log n)	    O(log n)

Feature	               Linear Search	          Binary Search
Data requirement	    Unsorted	                Sorted by key
Implementation	      Simple	                  Slightly more complex
Scalability	          Poor with large data     Excellent for large data
