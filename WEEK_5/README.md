# Kafka Chat App using C# (.NET) on Windows

This project demonstrates a **real-time chat system** using **Apache Kafka** as the message broker and **C# (.NET)** as the application layer. Messages are published by one user (producer) and received by another (consumer) in real-time using Kafka topics.

## ðŸ“Œ What is Apache Kafka?

**Apache Kafka** is an open-source distributed **event streaming platform** that:
- Handles high-throughput real-time data feeds
- Works on a **publish-subscribe** model
- Is fault-tolerant, scalable, and durable

Kafka is widely used for:
- Real-time analytics
- Log aggregation
- Messaging systems
- Event sourcing

ðŸ”§ Kafka & Zookeeper Setup (Windows)

âœ… 1. Start Zookeeper
Open Command Prompt 1 and run:

zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties
This starts the Zookeeper service which is required by Kafka for coordination.

âœ… 2. Start Kafka Server
Open Command Prompt 2 and run:
cd C:\kafka\bin\windows
kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties
This starts the Kafka broker on localhost:9092.

âœ… 3. Create Kafka Topic (Only once)
Open Command Prompt 3 and run:
cd C:\kafka\bin\windows
kafka-topics.bat --create --topic chat-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1

### 1. âœ… Download Kafka
